# whendoesthebellring (not coming soon)

No but seriously, when *does* it ring?

We all know you think [Classes](https://lordhelix.tk) is obscenely minimalistic and looks terrible on anything but a smartphone, and [Sublimate](https://sublimate.tk) is slow and boring.

[whendoesthebellring](http://whendoesthebellring.tk) is clearly what you need.

## Or you can just `git clone` and pretend you made it!
To run your own copy of whendoesthebellring, you gotta register up at the Student Portal for a schmick new SBHS App. Set your Redirect URI to something like `http://localhost:3000/callback`.

Then `git clone` this and fill out `config_example.js` and rename it to `config.js`.

`npm install`, `npm start [your chosen port]` and you're now the coolest kid on the block. Guaranteed!

Notice I didn't make you set any environment variables, whatever they are, like the evil overlord over at [Evil Timetabling Solutions Inc.](https://lordhelix.tk)
